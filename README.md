# React Example using OAuth2

This project is just a project example to learn how to use OAuth2 in React (frontend) and NodeJS (backend) using Sequelize as ORM to access a MySQL database.

The code is a simplification of the bluecity project. (find it here: https://github.com/tcrurav/bluecity.git)

## Getting Started

Download links:

From Github: https://github.com/tcrurav/ReactNodeOAuth2.git

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/ReactNodeOAuth2.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned the project install all dependencies.

```
cd ReactNodeOAuth2/frontend
npm install

cd ReactNodeOAuth2/backend
npm install
```

* For your frontend part, if you want to use the Google Login feature, you have to create a clientID by creating a new project on Google developers website.: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

In that page click on the blue button "Configure a project" to start the process of obtaining your clientID.

After clicking on the blue button you'll have to sign in Google, and then you will be able to create a new project:

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-17-bis.png)

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-18-bis.png)

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-19-bis.png)

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-20-bis.png)

In our local environment we can use the default http://localhost:3000 as the origin. For an explotation deployment you'll have to change/add your deployment URL.

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-21-bis.png)

And finally you get your ClientID:

![Create Project](/docs/screenshot-22-bis.png)

Your Google ClientID is used in the file ReactNodeOAuth2/frontend/src/components/my-login-with-google.js and should be inserted in the file ReactNodeOAuth2/frontend/.env in the following manner: 

```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com
REACT_APP_BASEURL=http://localhost:4000
```

Take into account the second line to introduce in the file ReactNodeOAuth2/frontend/.env necessary to indicate the base URL of your API.

* For your backend part:
1. You need a ReactNodeOAuth2/backend/.env file with a key for the JWT and the data for the connection to your MySQL Server:

```
JWT_SECRET=V3RY#1MP0RT@NT$3CR3T#

MYSQL_DATABASE=db_scooters_dev
MYSQL_USER=a_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=a_password_for_a_user
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=a_password_for_root

DB_HOST=localhost

NODE_ENV=development
```

2. You need a mysql server working.

3. Create the mysql database, that in our case is "db_scooters_dev". You can import it from the file db_scooters_dev.sql included in this project. https://github.com/tcrurav/ReactNodeOAuth2/blob/master/db_scooters_dev.sql


Finally to start enjoying this project.

```
cd bluecity/backend
node server.js

cd bluecity/frontend
npm start
```

Enjoy!!!
